### Ice Cream Reward

### Fictional app
To mess around using D3 the way it probably was *not* intended.

The concept behind this fake app:

> Run ran hard, you ran fast, you ran a lot. You burned a lot of calories, too. And you earned an ice cream!
> This is a promotion in partnership with your GPS watch and "21 Flavors" in Moose road, Concord, MA.
> Come to "21 Flavors" and show us the result of your run. We will make our best to reproduce this ice cream...
> And of course, it's on us! You totally earned it!
